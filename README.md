# fruit basket

fruit basket is a growing collection of miscellaneous projects used to exercise and improve coding skills. currently all "fruit" in the "basket" are written in C#. however, i'll eventually add other languages as i learn them better.

initially, this project started simply writing code. as time progresses, all items will include unit tests (often implementing TDD).

below is a list of fruit basket items and their current status

## miscellaneous

**[Collatz Conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)**

the Collatz Conjecture takes a seed number and generates a hailstone sequence

**notes**

+ currently works with long numbers

---

**[Equilibrium Indice](http://codility.com/demo/take-sample-test/)**

a function that, given a numeric array, returns the indice where equilibrium exists (sum of all indices before equal sum of all indices after).

this problem comes from codility.com

**notes**

+ only returns first equilibrium (if multiple exist)
+ works only with integers

---

**List Extensions**

*prime number sieve*

takes a numeric list and sieves out composite numbers, leaving only primes.

**notes**

+ works only with integers

*simple shuffle and swap*

iterates a list of items, starting at zeroth index, randomly choosing another list member and swaps the two

**notes**

+ works with any List of type T

---

**Factorial Recursion**

uses a recursive method to calculate the factorial of a given number

**notes**

static method accepts an integer parameter and returns up to a long
